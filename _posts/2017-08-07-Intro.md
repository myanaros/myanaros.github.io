Welcome to my site, I am a Security Engineer at Appfolio.

I like dynamic code analysis, and tools that allow for better awareness from a security
point of view in different environments.

Whether this is through training or tools that are meant to be used in Incident 
Response, they can include...


- Writing security training applications like [destiny_app](https://github.com/myanaros/destiny_app)
- Writing ruby code that will do correlation for me (Who likes _reading_ logs anyway)
- Using static code analysis tools like [brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org/){:target="\_blank"}


Past efforts included developing a ruby script that can be required into any
other ruby program that will report a specific vulnerability present in the loaded
classes. I would use this in security assessments as a complement to static code
analysis with **brakeman** to find silly code like the following...


```ruby
# Hello I am a method YAML.load likes to use to allow code injection.
def []= key, val
  instance_eval "@#{key}=\"#{val}\""
end
```
